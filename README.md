### Software Engineering Student | Aspiring Backend Developer

I’m a software engineering student focused on building **reliable, scalable, and user-centered** applications. I enjoy bridging academic concepts with real-world systems by writing clean, maintainable code and strengthening core backend fundamentals.

* **Currently Building:** Backend-driven applications using **Node.js, Express, and EJS**.
* **Learning Path:** Expanding into full-stack development with **React**, with a planned transition to **Python, Django, and PostgreSQL**.
* **Philosophy:** Turning complex logic into simple, efficient, and well-documented systems.
